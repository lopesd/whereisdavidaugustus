Met Jon and Jonathan, two Navajo Indians who fed me by the fire and nourished my soul with good conversation. And their appreciation for each other. Jon, the cranky but kind old man with a titanium hip. Jonathan, the young hard-working helpful fellow with a good work ethic and head on his shoulders. Well, except for the anti-scientific theories he was parroting from YouTube. Wait, can onions really fight COVID? I'm gonna look real dumb when the research starts backing him.
<br><br>
Hunters. They tell stories of finding dead people around these parts. Murdered, or killed by driving off the side of the road. Yikes! I take it as a warning to redouble my caution on the twisting road. Also, to avoid murderers.`,
