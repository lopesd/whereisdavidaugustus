It was originally designed as a low-key SPA (single page application) that would fetch checkins from the backend and render them in the browser. As the number of checkins grew it became obvious that some pre-rendering would be needed if I really wanted to keep it crispy - so I've had a wonderful time in the last few days re-architecting this thing into a mostly static website.

I finally uploaded my source code to GitHub. Link below. Big oops though: my git commit history apparently contains my AWS Access Key and Google Maps API Key in plaintext?? Weird, someone must've snuck in at night and committed those. AWS and Google both let me know via email that I needed to rotate those creds as soon as I could. Hey it's good to know they're scraping GitHub and looking out for you!

Some bullet points to keep it digestible:

- I created stronger separations between my source code and content. Images and videos have their own directory on my local machine and go into their own S3 bucket. I used distribution behaviors in CloudFront to make sure the same distribution fronts both the website source and its content.

- Giulio was right, you learn the most by just messing around with the AWS console. I took a nosedive approach to AWS CodePipeline and do not regret it. Pushing code to my main GitHub branch triggers a build and a deploy.

- My build step runs a simple Rakefile that uses ERB (embedded Ruby) to template the source files (index.html.erb most notably). Did you know ERB is part of the Ruby standard library???

- TODO: Get peeps working again. Since the website is now static, triggering a peep doesn't do much. Ivan's idea of keeping only the latest open peep dynamic and statically generating the HTML for all claimed peeps is a good one. I still need some creative thinking to make peeps seem quick and seamless though. Might have to use HTML local storage, aka fancy cookies.

Speaking of, I'm hungry. And I didn't get a wink of sleep.

          <div class="devlog-entry-content"><span class="devlog-entry-date">Fri Oct 30 2020 1:27PM | </span><b>Backfilling image dimensions | </b>I thought my days of running backfill scripts were over. Today I wrote some Ruby to grab the dimensions of every checkin image and augment the checkin JSON with those dimensions. This is needed because if you don't set width and height of the image tag before it fully loads, the page won't preallocate the right amount of room for each image. So if the user scrolls down past the images while they are still loading, the page will appear to flicker as the HTML updates the sizes of the img tags.

I wasn't planning on fixing this bug yet but since I'm planning on pushing some features that require a consistent scrolling experience, the priority got bumped.</div>

I've made some significant steps and have a working prototype, but there are a few more hurdles and design decisions to make before this thing is just the way I want it.

TL;DR: GoPros since the Hero5 sample GPS coordinates multiple times per second while recording. This GPS data, alongside a lot of other telemetry, is encoded as a track within the MP4 files alongside the video and audio streams, in a format called GPMF (GoPro Metadata Format). Which is super cool! A combination of two open-source tools (gpmf-extract and gopro-telemetry) allow you to extract and export the data automatically as GeoJSON, from which you can easily read the lat/lng coordinates array, match them with their corresponding entries in the relative milliseconds array (it's called RelativeMicroSeconds, but it's lying), and voila - you have a route and a timeline for your icon to follow.

There is one big hurdle, and it's taken up a decent amount of time to solve to my satisfaction. If you trim any portion of the MP4 that has a GPMF track, the GPMF track becomes unreadle by the libraries I mentioned. It must be because of whatever compression algorithm is being used. The obvious solution is to extract the coordinate data first and then trim both, but that would be super tedious to do manually for every GoPro video I want to trim, so obviously I stood up a local node express server with a simple front-end that lets me pick the trim start and end times, gives me a live preview, trims both the video and metadata, and makes it easy to attach them to a checkin. I'm just trying to enable my artistic side!

The Colorado River checkin (which, as of this writing, no one has peeped yet ðŸ‘€) is the first example of this in action on the live website, though it doesn't have the moving icon yet. Zoom in on the location of the marker and you'll see the route taken by the video. Eventually I want to make that zoom automatic, and obviously I want that moving icon. There's a lot of design considerations to take into account with the automatic zoom, especially on mobile. That's a story for another devlog post.

Just for fun, here's what the server looks like:

<b>Giulio Finestrali</b> was the original peeper - among other things, he helped with AWS Lambda@Edge and fixing caching problems

<b>Ivan Petkov</b> is constantly checking this thing and giving me feedback - he even caught an XSS vuln and proved it by hacking my mainframe. He also holds the record for most peeps

<b>Jake Jensen</b> has since smashed Ivan's record, including a ridiculous penta peep streak

<b>Ari Richtberg</b> was a soundboard and focus mate as I was fixing caching problems and writing templating logic
