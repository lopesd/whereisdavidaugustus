-- FIXING THE FUCKING CACHE --
- never cache index.html
- version everything else
- points of website modification:
  -> 1) build time
    - append a timestamp to every non-index filename
    - change all file references to use that timestamp
      - design and use templating standard
      - replace all uses of the template with the timestamped filename
    - upload everything
      - how do we avoid massive bucket clutter
      - maybe we just deal with it later? it won't affect my souce code
  -> 2) checkin time
    - append to the database
    - changes will be pulled live and consistent directly from the database
    - requires an AJAX call
  -> 3) peep time
    - append to the database
    - changes will be pulled live and consistent directly from the database
    - requires an AJAX call
