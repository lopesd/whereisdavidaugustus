-- Competing priorities -- 
What I want to have: my priority is feeling engaged with viewers
- ability to check in via phone
- increased user engagement, so more peeps
What will keep viewers engaged
- interaction between markers and checkin cards
- better carousel
- high quality images and video
- route drawn on map
Infrastructure to hold it together
- DynamoDB for better organization, avoid eventual consistency, speed of insert for peeps and checkins. But would require either server-side templating or some other pre-rendering solution
- Better templating to keep the front-end from turning to spaghetti, which might necessitate a build system
- Workspace improvements, including github (or NAWS) integration, deploy on code push, beta env, typescript, etc

Let's talk about each:
- checkin via phone: this one is v important, and shouldn't even be that hard. I don't like having to backfill and I suspect it makes the website less live and therefore less relatable.
- more peeps: a great upgrade but too much work to refactor right now, since anything more complex would require auth to do properly. but we should add a leaderboard, would be quick, fun, and engaging - an easy win
- interaction between markers and checkin cards: this is high visibility and would be a defining feature of the website. it's been requested multiple times by different users and honestly I wouldn't launch the site without it. big investment though because of the complex refactor required on mobile
- better carousel: it's fine the way it is EXCEPT users without a trackpad have a hard time scrolling left on images, so we def need a button to swipe to next
- higher quality images: good, but not a priority. having one quality, visible in the carousel, is enough for now. lightbox later.
- video: big. integration with youtube should be the first step. which is good because it'd be nice to have more videos on youtube anyway. We can go through and replace them later if we want.
- route drawn on map: also big. possibly bigger than video.

Alright, rough prioritization then:
- phone checkin
  - cache fix!!
- map interaction
- fix carousel
- video
- further gamification and reCAPTCHA to prevent bots


-- design -- 
- it's a SPA duh
- homepage
  - shows the map, with full route starting in seattle, and current location highlighted
  - touching/clicking on a location on the map will go to that log entry in the log scroll page
- log entry features
  - location
    - each log entry is associated with a start/end location and a route
    - on mobile, you scroll down into it first
    - on desktop, it's on the left. the route is created with a 1 second delay
  - the journal entry
    - swipe horizontally to see multiple pages
    - transcript pages appended to the end
    - arrow icons to indicate swipeability?
  - images
    - a grid of images
    - swipe horizontally to see one at a time
    - tap on an image to auto-swipe to that image in the carousel
