here's what it'll look like:
- turn on the gopro
- turn click the button in the app on the phone
- phone pairs and tells it to start recording
- phone samples location data every x seconds
- recording can be quitted by either turning the gopro off (the phone should detect this) or pushing a button on the phone (it can tell the gopro to turn off)
- later, we somehow pair the location metadata and enrich the video with it, worst case as a json file on the side
