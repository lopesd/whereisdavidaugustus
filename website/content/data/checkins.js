Today was rough and filled with questions.\n\nBut tonight at the campsite I met three bikers with a diverse set of motorcycles - an old-school V-Strom (pre-beak), a Harley Dynah Street Bob, and a frankenstein project dirt bike that at one point was some sort of Honda (I think?). Jeff, Thomas, and Chris. Cherry and friendly af. Thomas pulls up a metal pannier by the fire for me to sit on. I pull it back a couple more feet. COVID rules. And what a surprise - they have no plans and no dates either! They're hitting the coast tomorrow and just gonna mosey on wherever the wind takes them. Thomas is a software dev like me, and Jeff even lives on the bike like I do. I lay down the questions and we talk it through. I get recommendations, stories, laughs. Lots of laughs. These guys are nuts. Jeff gives me a sticker that says \"Go fast, don't die\".\n\nI wanted to feel sane. I still feel crazy. But at least I'm not alone.",
