Jeff, Thomas, and Chris. Cherry and friendly af. Thomas pulls up a metal pannier by the fire for me to sit on. I pull it back a couple more feet. COVID rules. And what a surprise - they have no plans and no dates either! They're hitting the coast tomorrow and just gonna mosey on wherever the wind takes them. Thomas is a software dev like me, and Jeff even lives on the bike like I do. I lay down the questions and we talk it through. I get recommendations, stories, laughs. Lots of laughs.

Moonlight bounces off the twists in the creek, and it looks like eyes are watching. I even walked out there with my fight stick in hand to ward off whatever it was. Not sure what the plan was, honestly.\n\nDid I mention I recruited a fight stick? This thing is a freaking longsword. I was practicing my swings earlier. What am I so afraid of? Well, wildlife. I've taken all the proper bear safety precautions (you know, for all the desert bears) but I don't know if there's anything else out there. Coyotes? Shit. I don't know. This stick probably wouldn't make a difference in a fight, but it does make me feel better.\n\nClaudia, a hostel friend, spotted this cave when we were hiking the Mill Creek Waterfall Loop earlier today. It's hidden in plain sight in the canyonside, far off enough that most people aren't paying close enough attention to see it. We crossed the creek to explore it - me, Claudia, and David. Other David.\n\nOther David is a seeker. He's two years younger than me. He ditched his church a few years ago and is on a quest for highest truth. He's a thoughtful guy, not content with small talk, and so instead we try to define love and the soul. I'm richer for it. Claudia is a masseuse. I helped her set up her business address with Google and SquareSpace. She's working from the hostel, taking tourist clients in the city. No funny business. We talk about how she protects herself from weirdos.\n\nThe fire I started is just red coals now. Soon it'll start getting cold in my little cave. Seriously, what an awesome little cave.\n\nMan, some interesting people at the Lazy Lizard. Bill might have been my favorite. He's a techie troubadour like me! He's older (pushing 50 maybe) and likes to build webapps that track location history and download maps directly to your phone. He recommends I switch from Google Maps to Leaflet, and we bond over GeoJSON. Amazing! It seems like a silly thing to bond over, until you think about what it really means to both of us: an intersection between exploration and tech, two of our shared passions.\n\nBill even showed me how to fashion a weed bowl out of a soda can, which came in handy tonight. Actually, now that I think about it, weed is probably why I was stupid paranoid about coyotes earlier. Or maybe it's the Halloween spirit? Oof! It's definitely getting colder in here. I should sleep. Without a sleep mask, I'm forced to get up with the sun. I used to have a sleep mask, but... it was in the backpack. Keep forgetting to replace it.",

It's got more greenery to it than I saw in the canyons in Utah - which is a plus in these PNW-accustomed eyes - and the multi-day hike to the river and back is a tantalizing challenge that I've bookmarked for a later time.\n\nHonestly, it was sensorial and emotional overload after a point. Maybe my heart, or my spirit, or whatever it is, isn't wide open enough to let all the light in. Am I broken?  Is my rational grip on reality so tight that I've blotted out the sublime?\n\nNah. That's just talk. I've been struck by many things in the last 36 days, things that make me laugh manically and whoop into my helmet and string together expletives as creatively as I can. It's just hard to be fully appreciative when I'm running low on sleep (mild insomnia, my arch nemesis!). You learn, after years of living in an emotional human, to have a checklist for when your emotions feel off. Am I tired? Hungry? Thirsty? Lacking in exercise? Sick or in pain somewhere? Our physical bodies are, for the most part, responsible for the state of our brains. It's an obvious fact, but it bears the reminder. At least, for me.\n\nUnrelated but - what better way to appreciate this country than to visit the Grand Canyon, eat some apple pie, and watch an election unfold?",

      "blurb": "Mount Lemmon was disgusting. One full hour of twisting highway (with even an occasional switchback!) grants you gradually more spectacular views of a mountainside that's way too green for this kind of desert, peppered with boulders and rock formations that look almost intentionally arranged, all set under the kind of vastly empty sky and maximally distant horizon that only the desert offers. It's like someone mashed together the best parts of Washington, Utah, and Arizona. Make sure you catch the sunset on the way down. I've never seen a mountainside quite so pink set against a sky so deeply orange.\n\nAt the top is a little community called Summerhaven, with a gift shop, cabins, a few eateries. I park just outside the Cookie Cabin and sit for a while lamenting how crowded the dessert shop is. I want a cookie. But I'm not going in. COVID rules. A young lady (early college aged, I'm guessing) notices me on the bike and waves. \"Can I get on the back??\" \"Sure,\" I joke. She's serious though, and promptly gets up and walks over. \"Uhhh, I don't have a helmet for you...\" \"Can you just go slow? I haven't been on a bike in ten years. Lately I've been ranting about wanting to ride one.\" I allow it. She puts on her mask, hops on the back, and we take a short joyride to the ski resort and back. Her name's Madelyn, and she comes from a family of Harley riders. She puts the ride on Snapchat and asks me to do a wheelie. Freakin' zoomers.\n\nNear the summit, take a right and continue past the fire district. A primitive rocky road begins. Old Mt Lemmon Road slithers northeast down the mountain, so thoroughly twisty you'd think it was carved by a river. I can't resist the call, but I also can't confidently break 15mph in this rough terrain. My Honda NC700X lies partway between adventure and street bike. I've got the tires and suspension to do this kind of thing, but the lackluster ground clearance and medium weight class mean I should stay away from anything you wouldn't classify as \"light off-roading\". Trust me. I nearly died in the Yakima desert proving this to myself. \n\nFifteen minutes down the rocky road, I run into an older gentleman on a red Honda CRF250 going up the mountain. We stop next to each other with grins and knowing looks in our eyes. We're part of the same tribe. During solitary moments like these, meeting someone who's on the same kind of journey instantly generates a kind of provisional familiarity - an intimacy, even. \"Turn your bike all the way off,\" he advises, implying he wants more than just a cursory exchange of pleasantries. I oblige. He takes a look at my bike, and I know exactly what he's thinking. \"Don't worry,\" I say, \"I know not to bite off more than I can chew.\" His CRF is a much better fit for this kind of trail. With a skeptical glance, he points to an angry pile of rocks on the side of the road and says \"THAT'S what the road looks like about half a mile down. Rocks so sharp they'll tear your tires rim to rim.\" Gulp. I assure him that I'm not going much further and that I know my limits - though I'm grateful for the heads up. We trade stories.\n\nAs the sun sets and I head back down the way I came in, I stop at a pullout for a picture. The family in the car ahead of me looks... a little off? I ask them if they're OK, and the young father says \"yeah we're good - just having a little throw-up problem\" as he herds his toddler back into the car. A kid pokes her head out the window, sees my GoPro, and asks \"Do you have a YouTube channel??\" \"Yeah!\" \"Are you famous??\" \"Nope!\" \"Oh.\" Freakin' zoomers.",
